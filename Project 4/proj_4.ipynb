    "\n",
    "Heat diffusion is a process where heat spreads out in a material. A diffusion equation that gives the temperature at any position at any time is represented as a differential equation of space and time. This exact form equation can be simplified by first considering a one dimension representation, and then approximating over multiple length and time segments. By splitting up a segment of material, we can approximate that the slope of the temperature distribution is constant over each segment, allowing us to numerically and iteratively calculate a temperature for each segment for each step in time. Kobiske and Hock describes a numerical method to solve a simple 1D rectangular copper bar, and a 3D spherically symmetric copper sphere. Figures representing the temperature at each position for various moments in time are shown in the paper, and by following the method of numerical approximation, I am able to reproduce and match the original figures published by Kobiske and Hock.
