def weighted_die(num_steps):
	"""
	Perform a MCMC simulation on a weighted dice, and return the expected earnings for a predetermined weighted dice and payout. 

	This method runs an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to simulate the results of rolling a weighted dice with six sides. The dice is weighted such that sides 1 and 2 are each three times more likely to land face up than sides 3, 4, 5, and 6. The payout is such that every time the die lands on side 1 or side 2, you win one dollar, and every time the die lands on side 3, 4, 5, or 6, you lose one dollar. 
	
	The specific algorithm used is the Metropolis Algorithm, and the argument num_steps is the number of times this algorithm is performed. In other words, num_steps is the number of dice rolls simulated. 

	Args:
		num_steps (int): Length of MCMC sequence. Number of dice rolls. 

	Returns:
		float: This method returns the expected winnings after num_steps, which is an integer value.
